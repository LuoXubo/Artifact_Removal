# CT metal artifact reduction

## Pipeline

This repository aims to reduce metal artifact in CT images via Radon transformation and linear interpolation.

After that, the CT images will be input into next part for 3D reconstruction and finally being converted into \*.STL file.

The details about metal artifact reduction can be found [here](https://luoxubo.github.io/2022/06/28/CT%E4%BC%AA%E5%BD%B1%E5%8E%BB%E9%99%A4/).
